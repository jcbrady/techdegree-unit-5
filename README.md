Unit 5 - Working with API's

Additional Features to CSS
• Added drop shadows to the 12 cards
• Added a hover effect to subtly scale up the names and photos
• Added background image to page for a textured effect
• Centered modal content to match mockup

Consider Additional Features to JavaScript
• I want to add functionality to close modal window if user clicks the background, but this goal is sidetracking me right now. Will come back ot it
